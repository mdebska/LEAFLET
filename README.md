# LEAFLET
Site for searching attractions in the bounds of the drawn figures (rectangle or circle marker). Attractions are shown based on up-to-date temperature (we take temperature data from the middle of the drawn figure). If the temperature is < 10 degrees Celsius, displayed attraction spots are mainly under the roof (eg. cinema, museum) and if it's > 10, most of them are outside (eg. zoo, theme park).
